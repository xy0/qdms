<h1><strong>Query Display Management System</strong></h1>
<p>QDMS is a minimal approach to multi-domain content display and communications platform. Started in 2005 in a High School web design class, this program continues to exactly what I personally need, and with any luck, what other people may want as well. This project has taught me everything I know about web design and programming, and continues to grow as I do. Eventually I hope to replace the need for centralized social-media web hubs in place of an easily networked common protocol in which I will call SQDP (Social Query Display Protocol).</p>
